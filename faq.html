	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</header>

<p class="w3-container">
Noone asked us anything, so we made this up.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-container">What's wrong with the default software on Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p class="w3-container">
Nothing, really. It's perfect for what it's designed for.
</p>

<p class="w3-container">
It, however makes us a bit worried. It contains drivers not present in mainline kernel
that didn't pass the rigourous review process Linux is known and valued for. They, for
instance, expose files in <tt>/dev</tt> that expose raw access to hardware for an unprivileged
user. This is something that's probably fine on a toy, but something very uncommon for
a production Linux system.
</p>

<p class="w3-container">
It also ships no SELinux by default and it's not trivial to make it work.
Also, despite arguably a matter of taste, we prefer RPM to DEB.
<p>

<h3 class="w3-container">You did an Alpha release. When are you doing a real release?</h3>

<p class="w3-container">
When it's ready. Which likely is Q1 2016.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-container">How can I help?</h3>

<p class="w3-container">
Become a Fedora packager.
</p>

<p class="w3-container">
Donations of hardware and money for the build cluster are very welcome.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-container">What hardware do you support?</h3>

<p class="w3-container">
We target all BCM2835-based (<tt>armv6</tt>) boards:
</p>

<p>
<ul class="w3-container w3-margin-left">
<li>Raspberry Pi Model A</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Model A+</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Model B</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Compute Module</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="w3-container">
Raspberry Pi 2 Model B is not supported.
</p>

<h3 class="w3-container">What is your relation to Pidora?</h3>

<p class="w3-container">
We aim to continue where Pidora has left off. Without insulting the Russian speaking folks ;)
